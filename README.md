# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life (wiki: [RU](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%96%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8C_(%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0)), [EN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)). The main task is to write your own version of John Conway's Life game, in each session using something new - platforms or programming languages.

## What is in this repository?

In this repository, I'll try to collect (perhaps and implement to the logical conclusion) several different implementations of this game.  
Each folder in the repository will develop its own platform. Each folder will create its own README.md file with explanations, for which platform, in which programming language, on which framework, etc. a project is being developed.
  
For an example look [ofConwaysLife/ofConwaysLife/README.md](ofConwaysLife/ofConwaysLife/README.md)

## What for?

Initially, this was done in preparation for the event in St. Petersburg [***Global Day of Coderetreat***](https://www.meetup.com/EPAM-IT-EVENTS/events/244312858/). Several templates were created to use and develop them later.
In the future, this is for the fan and the experience of experimenting with new technologies.
